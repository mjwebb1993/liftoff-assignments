# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In short, my project will revolve around two core features that will respectively branch out to intertwine into one application. These two core features are a database users can upload their files/documents to and a forum where users can converse with other users about any document that they have access to on the database. The basic idea is to be able to allow groups of individuals to view these documents and be able to disucuss them in real time. Now while there are applications with similar functionalities, far too many applications have an insufficent means for users to talk among themselves, or the applications that do have branched out to implement an avalanche of features that drown out the simple purpose of this proposed project. This application will be able to give users a better experience as it will be more streamlined in its overall purpose as compared to other similar applications.
### Features
Key features will include users being able to:
- create and authenticate accounts
- be able to manage their documents through CRUD functionality
- search for documents by either title or "contains"
- users will be able to add other users to a group/list for easier access
### Technologies
The majority of the code will be written in JAVA, with also needing to implement Spring and CRUD functionality. Will also need to have whatever technology allows for the social aspect of the application as well as the forum feature itself.
Java
SPring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf Templates
CRUD repository
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to effeciently allow multiple users view a document from a database, which we covered in the last parts of Assignments 3 and 4 of Unit 2 but I'll need to become more versed in tying it together for this application. I also will need to learn how to implement a forum inside of a web application, and also how to give users access to other users in a typical social fassion.
